# LTC3260-breakout-board
# Overview
The LTC3260 provides a very low noise dual rail for projects requiring very stable supplies (ADCs, op amps). The main difference between the LTC3260 and the LTC3265 is the absense of a boost regulator on the LTC3260, which makes it more suitable for low voltage rails (e.g., a +/- 5V rail from a +9V battery). The negative rail is generated by an inverting charge pump directly on the input voltage. Both outputs can then be used unregulated, or using the built-in LDOs. [You can find the official documentation for the chip here](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc3260.html). This is a breakout board made in Kicad with a barrel jack power input [(the PJ-037A)](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/cui-inc/PJ-037A/CP-037A-ND/1644545) and [SMA connectors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G94UK74/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for shielded, low noise power transfer over distance. 

*_Note_*: The board is currently designed for a +/- 5V rail for a 9V battery input. You can adjust the output voltage by tweaking either voltage divider, where the specific formula for output voltage is given on page 10 of the technical manual. 

# Navigating this repo
The main folder contains relevant Kicad files (.pro, .pcb, .sch). The `gerber` directory has a PCB-fabrication ready set of gerber files. The `library` directory contains a custom kicad footprint for the PJ-037A and the SMA connector.
